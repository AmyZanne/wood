# directory `zae`

Files from Zanne et al. (in press at Nature).  Once the script
`zae/download.R` is run, the following files will be present:

* `GlobalWoodinessDatabase.csv`: list of species with their woodiness
  status.  See `woodinessReadme.txt` for more information.
* `Spermatophyta_Genera.csv`: Taxonomic information relating plant
  genera, families and orders.  This is used for computing the numbers
  of woody species at the family and order level.
* `genus_order_lookup.csv`: Generated from `Spermatophyta_Genera.csv`,
  with just the `genus`, `family` and `order` columns included.
* `Vascular_Plants_rooted.dated.tre`: very large phylogeny
  of plants.  This is used only for display purposes.

# directory `geo`

Contains the file `country_coords.csv`, which contains nominal
latitude and longitude for 259 countries, for use with the survey
results.  This file is automatically generated from
`wood-functions.R:build.country.list()`, using data from files hosted
on [GBIF](http://www.gbif.org).

# in this directory:

* `survey_results.csv`: survey responses containing a guess as to what
  fraction of species are woody, along with information about botany
  training, familiarity and location.
* `high-level-taxonomy.csv`: Lookup table, manually constructed, that
  links plant orders to high level clades.  This is used only for
  colouring the tree figures.
* `genus_order_lookup_extra.csv`: Lookup table with extra
  genus/family/order relationships, for non-seed plants.  This is
  merged with `zae/genus_order_lookup.csv`
* `spermatophyta_synonyms_PLANTLIST.csv`: Synonym and species numbers
  from The Plant List.
