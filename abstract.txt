The question posed by the title of this paper is a basic one; it is
surprising that the answer is not known given that the
woody/herbaceous divide is perhaps the most fundamental axis of
functional diversity among plants.  We informally surveyed a broad
community of biologists to determine whether a consensus answer to our
question existed - even if not documented in the peer-reviewed
literature.  No such consensus existed, with estimates ranging from 1%
to 90% (mean: 31.7%).  With a database of woodiness for 49,064 species
of vascular plants we estimated the status of the remaining 235,668
species using two randomisation approaches.  We estimated the
proportion of woodiness among the world's vascular plants to be
between 45% and 48%.  This estimate is larger than 81% of the
estimates in our survey, most of which substantially underestimated
the proportion of the world's flora that was woody.  The results of
our survey highlight that global datasets can show patterns at odds
with conventional wisdom.
