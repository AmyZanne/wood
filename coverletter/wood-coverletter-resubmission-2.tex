Dear Drs. Gibson and Sandhu,

We would like to submit our revised manuscript ``How much of the world is woody?'' (JEcol-2014-0015) 
for publication in Journal of Ecology.

We appreciate the thoroughness of the comments we received throughout the review process and feel that our paper is much stronger as a result.

The revisions we have made for this submission are very minor. We hope that our paper is not suitable for publication in your journal. We look forward to hearing from you.
