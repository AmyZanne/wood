Dear Drs. Gibson and Sandhu,

We would like to resubmit our manuscript ``How much of the world is woody?'' (JEcol-2013-0465) 
for your re--consideration as a ``Future Directions'' article in the Journal of Ecology.
We received a rejection decision on 3 Oct. 2013 and were encouraged to resubmit our article.

We appreciate the thoroughness of the reviewers' comments and feel that our submission is much 
stronger as a result.

The most serious concerns of the reviewers can be broadly construed as falling into three categories:
1) that our definition of the woody habit was perhaps inappropriate; 2) that we failed to adequately
demonstrate how we got from the raw data to the final resuls; and 3) that we did not adequately 
present the full results of the analysis.

To address these criticisms we have substantially overhauled our submission; however, a great 
deal of the new material is included as supplementary material to the manuscript. The raw data is now
included with all the steps necessary to perform the analysis. We have investigated the robustness of 
our results to various sources of bias. And we include a far more complete presentation of the results
from every subclade analyzed. This will make our results both more transparent and hopefully re--usable
by other resesarchers.

We hope that you will consider this submission acceptable for publication in your journal and 
look forward to hearing from you.
